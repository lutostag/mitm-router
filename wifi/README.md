# ‚ò† Man-in-the-middle Router üåê

Turn any linux computer into a public Wi-Fi network that silently mitms all http traffic. Runs inside a Docker container using [hostapd](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hostapd), [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html), and [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) to create a open honeypot wireless network named "Public". For added fun, change the network name to "xfinitywifi" to autoconnect anyone who has ever connected to those networks... they are everywhere.

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/brannondorsey/mitm-router
cd mitm-router

# build the image this step can be omitted if you prefer to pull 
# the image from the docker hub repository
docker build . -t brannondorsey/mitm-router
```

Run the following, replacing `AP_IFACE` and `INTERNET_IFACE` with your wireless device and internet-connected ethernet/wireless devices respectively. You can can get see the name of your network devices by running `ifconfig`.

```bash
# run the container
docker run -it --net host --privileged \
-e AP_IFACE="wlan0" \
-e INTERNET_IFACE="eth0" \
-e SSID="Public" \
-v "$(pwd)/data:/root/data" \
brannondorsey/mitm-router
```

If all went well, you should see something like this:

```
Current MAC:   a5:ae:f9:a4:b7:e3 (TP-LINK TECHNOLOGIES CO.,LTD.)
Permanent MAC: a5:ae:f9:a4:b7:e3 (TP-LINK TECHNOLOGIES CO.,LTD.)
New MAC:       00:d2:6b:d5:fe:bd (PHOTRON USA)
[ ok ] Starting system message bus: dbus.
[ ok ] Starting DNS forwarder and DHCP server: dnsmasq.
[ ok ] Starting advanced IEEE 802.11 management: hostapd.
Proxy server listening at http://0.0.0.0:1337
```

`mitm-router` transparently captures all `HTTP` traffic sent to the router at `10.0.0.1:80`. It does **not** intercept HTTPS traffic (port `443`) as doing so would alert a user that a possible man-in-the-middle attack was taking place. Traffic between URLs that begin with `https://` will not be captured. 

The `mitm-router/data/` folder is shared with the docker container so that we can view the capture files that it places there on our host machine. By default, you will find the `mitmdump` capture file in `mitm-router/data/http-traffic.cap`.

You can also connect your `INTERNET_IFACE` to a hostpot running on your phone your for mitm pwnage on the go ;)

If something seems like it went wrong, see the [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.md).

## Bringing the Network Down

Bring the docker container down to reset the iptable routing rules.

```bash
# get the name of your container
docker ps

# attach to the container
docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME>
```

```
Proxy server listening at http://0.0.0.0:1337
[ ok ] Stopping DNS forwarder and DHCP server: dnsmasq.
[ ok ] Stopping advanced IEEE 802.11 management: hostapd.
[ ok ] Stopping system message bus: dbus.
received shutdown signal, exiting.
```

## MAC Randomization

By default, `mitm-router` randomizes the MAC address of your `AP_IFACE` to anonymize your network device. This can be disabled with the `MAC="unchanged"` environment variable. You can also explicitly set the `AP_IFACE` MAC address with `MAC="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"`.  

## Configuring

Supported environment variables are listed below with their default values:

```bash
# wireless device name that will be used for the Access Point
AP_IFACE="wlan0"

# device name that is used for the router's internal internet connection
# packets from AP_IFACE will be forwarded to this device
INTERNET_IFACE="eth0"

# wireless network name
SSID="Public"

# optional WPA2 password; if left empty network will be public
PASSWORD=""

# optional randomization of AP_IFACE MAC address
# can be set to a specific value like "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
# or "unchanged" to leave the device MAC alone
MAC="random"

# tcpdump output file location inside the container
CAPTURE_FILE="/root/data/http-traffic.cap"

# optional mitmproxy filter
# see http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/features/filters.html
FILTER=""
```

## Security

This access point runs inside of Docker for isolation, ensuring that any vulnerabilities that may be exploitable in the access point will not allow an adversary access to your computer or home network. That said, there are a few caveats to be aware of:

- `--net host` shares all of the network interfaces and `iptables` entries from the host machine with the docker container. Assume that a vulnerable docker container would have root access to these devices.
- Running in `--privileged` mode gives extended permissions to the docker container
- Your host machine (the one running docker) **will** be accessible on the "Public" network as a connected client. For this reason, please use a firewall (`ufw` on linux) to block incoming traffic on all ports so that computers on the "Public" network do not have access to exposed services your machine.
- All traffic on the honeypot network will be outbound from you home network's gateway. If someone on the "Public" network is torrenting or conducting illegal activity you will be held accountable and your ISP may cancel your service. <!--For this reason, I recommend you run a [VPN](https://airvpn.org/) on the host linux machine (the one that is running docker) to protect yourself. Doing so will cause all traffic from the host machine, and in turn the honeypot network, to be tunneled through the VPN. Also, be sure to pick a VPN that doesn't log your traffic ;)-->

For added security, I prefer to run this docker container on a dedicated computer, like a Raspberry Pi.

## Attribution

This code started as a hard fork of [simonschuang's rpi-hostapd](https://github.com/simonschuang/rpi-hostapd). The code has been heavily modified for mitm purposes.
